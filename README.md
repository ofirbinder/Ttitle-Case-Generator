### How to Use the Web Application

1. **Launching the Application**:
   - To run the application, simply click on the `index.html` file. This will open the application in your default web browser.

2. **Input Field**:
   - At the top of the page, you will find an input field where you can enter a string. This string will be converted to **Title Case**.
   - **Title Case** means that the first letter of each major word in the string will be capitalized. For example, "hello world" becomes "Hello World".
   - *NOTE: Only English letters are accepatable


3. **Character Filtering**:
   - The application will remove any characters that are not letters - `, # $  ^  `` ~`.

4. **Buttons**:
   - After entering your string, you will see two buttons:
     - **Create Title Case**: This button will convert the entered string to Title Case.
     - **Clear**: This button will clear both the input field and the output field.
     - **Copy To Clipboard**: This button will copy text from the input field to clipboard.
